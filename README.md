# Linear regression
Implementation is explained below

## Approach
1.The Basic gradient descent is implemented .
2. Learning rate are feed in array.
3. for each Learning rate we find the m and c corresponds to min cost .
4. we find the best m and c with having overall cost as minimum.
5. we compared with built in scikit model .
6. both the values are pretty same.
